# Pricecharting Pokemon Search

This browser extension adds an item to the context menu that allows you to quickly search for Pokemon cards by selecting text and pressing "Search Pricecharting".

If possible, it will parse the selection and find the card using the Pokemon TCG API (<https://pokemontcg.io>). If this fails, it opens a new tab to google search for the card.
